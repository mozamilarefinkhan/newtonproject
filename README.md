# react-credit-card
Created with CodeSandbox

Requirements
1. The form, must accept the following fields:
    Name on card: Text field, only letters and hyphen (-) allowed
    Card number: 16 digits
    Expiration Month: Month in the format MM
    Expiration Year: Year in the format YY
    CVC: 3 digits

2. It must validate that the above fields were entered correctly.
3. It must have a Submit button that when clicked will show a success message if the form is valid.
4. Show the credit card type logo when the card number is updated, i.e., Visa, Master Card, ...
  a) Use a third-party API or library to implement this.
  If you are running low in time we recommend to hardcode a function that returns a random credit card type. Something is better than nothing! ;)

5. Show a preview that looks like a real credit card. That preview should update while the user changes the form.
6. BONUS: Animate the preview.
